Integration Guide for Bet 33 Landing Page
This guide explains how to connect the static landing page to your backend services (Netlify, PayPal, Beehiiv).

1. Netlify IntegrationThis page is ready for Netlify deployment.
Forms: The newsletter form uses data-netlify="true". 
When you deploy to Netlify, the platform automatically detects this and starts collecting submissions in your Netlify Dashboard under "Forms".
Deployment: Simply drag and drop the folder containing index.html into the Netlify "Sites" dashboard.

2. Beehiiv (Newsletter)To switch from Netlify Forms to direct Beehiiv submission:
Go to your Beehiiv Dashboard -> Settings -> Subscribe Forms.
Copy the Embed URL or Form Action URL.
In index.html, locate the <form> tag in the #newsletter section.
Replace the <form> tag with your Beehiiv embed code, or simply update the action="..." attribute to point to Beehiiv's endpoint.

3. PayPal IntegrationThe pricing buttons currently are standard HTML buttons. 
To accept payments:

Log in to the PayPal Developer Dashboard (using the credentials you have in env.txt).
Generate a Smart Payment Button code snippet.

In index.html, locate the "Subscribe Now" button in the pricing card.

Replace the <button> with the PayPal <div> container provided by their SDK.

Add the PayPal JS SDK script to the <head> of the document:<script src="[https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&vault=true&intent=subscription](https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&vault=true&intent=subscription)"></script>

4. Connect / Manus AIThe "Powered by Manus AI" badge is currently cosmetic.
To make it functional (e.g., fetch live stats), you would typically create a Netlify Function (netlify/functions/get-stats.js) that calls the Manus API and returns the data to the frontend via fetch().
